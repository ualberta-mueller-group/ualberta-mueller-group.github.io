<h1>Writing Tips</h1>

<ul>
<li>
M Bowling:
The best thesis is a finished one. Your PhD is not the culmination of your lifeâ€™s work, but the ticket to start it. Good enough is great!

Matt Taylor:
Some of my students have gotten a lot of benefit out of working with a writing coach. But we also have a free option! Grad students can book up to 10 appointments per semester (F/W/S+S), which will probably be more than enough.

<h3>Using figures from other papers/textbooks</h3>
<p>
Qu:
What is the policy on using figures from other papers/textbooks in your thesis, given you have cited them? Is it allowed, common, or do people usually just re-create their own figures? An example is the Tile Coding figure from the RL book.

Robert Holte:
The following webpage has a link to a pdf about using copyrighted material in your thesis. There is a "fair dealing" concept that does not require you to get explicit permission.

There is a copyright office on campus that has more detailed guidelines, and you can always contact it for specific questions. See: https://www.ualberta.ca/faculty-and-staff/copyright/index.html
