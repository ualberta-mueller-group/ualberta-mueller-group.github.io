<h2>Lab or Office Space</h2>
<p>Each grad student is traditionally offered either a space in a (shared) office, or a space in a lab. Many students also prefer working from home. 
Some of my students are in the AI Lab (CSC 2-15). In the past, I also had students work in the RL and in the Algorithmics labs.

<h2>AI Lab</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Current Lab manager (as of August 2022): Zaheen Ahmad, zfahmad@ualberta.ca .
He assigns seats in the AI lab to students. Usually Martin talks to him about any changes.
