<h1>Research Resources</h1>

<h2>Git Version Control</h2>
<p>
We have a repository at
https://github.com/ualberta-mueller-group .
Currently, Ting-han Wei and Martin are administrators. We have both public and private repositories. We can create new ones for your projects and share with the right set of people.

<h2>Paper Editing - Overleaf</h2>
<p>
Martin has a paid subscription to Overleaf for the group. This allows benefits such as more co-authors. You can ask him to start a new project for a paper.
</p>

<p>
To change ownership of an existing overleaf project 
to my paid account, follow:
