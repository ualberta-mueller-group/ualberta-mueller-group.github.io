Cirrus

machines - account on cirrus:
Martin can request to add you.
Your Cirrus account will be initialized with the same user name and password as your ualberta password. However it is a separate system, so if you change one password it will not change on the other side.

access to cirrus:
The current rules restrict access from on campus.

You can either:

1) Use the campus VPN to get VPN into campus:

2) ssh into another computer on campus then ssh to the VMs aka a ssh jumphost.
Computing Science has a number of computers that one can ssh into from off campus.
The one that is specifically set asideÂ for this is: innisfree.cs.ualberta.ca
